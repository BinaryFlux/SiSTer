# SiSTer
Save sync script between the GBA cores on MiSTer and the Analogue Pocket's Spiritualized GBA Core


A simple script that pushes all the .sav files in the gba folder between the mister and the pocket


How To Use

1) On the Pocket, go to Tools -> Developer -> and enable "USB SD Access"
2) Plug the Analoge pocket directly into the mister using the USB expansion board [CAUTION, CURRENTLY ONLY WORKS WITH USB0, WHICH IS THE CENTRAL PORT ON THE SIDE WITH THE SD CARD INPUTS, WILL FIX SHORTLY]
3) From the Scripts menu on the mister, run "2pocket" to overwrite the saves on the pocket with the saves on the mister, or run "2mister" to overwrite the saves on the mister with the saves on the pocket
