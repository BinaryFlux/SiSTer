# SiSTer
Save sync script between the GBA cores on MiSTer and the Analogue Pocket's Spiritualized GBA Core


A simple script that pushes all the .sav files in the gba folder between the mister and the pocket

Setup
1) Take the "2Mister" and "2pocket" files, and place them in the "scripts" folder on your mister
2) On the Pocket, go to Tools -> Developer -> and enable "USB SD Access"

How To Use

1) Plug the Analogue pocket directly into the mister using the USB expansion board [May not work if other usb media devices are plugged into the mister, for maximum safety, remove any usb drives before initiating transfer.]
2) From the Scripts menu on the mister, run "2pocket" to overwrite the saves on the pocket with the saves on the mister, or run "2mister" to overwrite the saves on the mister with the saves on the pocket
